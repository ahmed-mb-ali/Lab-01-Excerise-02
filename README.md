Demonstrating the use of: "Fragements, tags, intent, Listview"


I have created three Activities and two Fragment Activities: Main Acitivity, AI Activity, VR Activity, First Fragment, Second Fragment.

I have created ListView to view the String Array in the main page and make it onListItemClick to intent to another activites.

First Fragment will display Listview: AI Activity, VR Activity.

Second Fragment: will display Toast class method to display a quick message

AI Activity and VR Activity: will display tags from method: OnStart, OnStop, onDestroy.
